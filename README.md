## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started
Copy the `RoClass` .rbxm file into `ReplicatedStorage` or `ServerStorage` (not recommended) and require it in your scripts:
```lua
local RoClass = require(pathToRoClass)
```

### Example
```lua
local Player = RoClass.new("Player")
    :constructor(function(self)
        self.Health = 100
        self.Mana = 50
    end)
    :method("TakeDamage", function(self, dmg)
        self.Health -= dmg
    end)
    :method("CastSpell", function(self, cost)
        if self.Mana >= cost then
            self.Mana -= cost
        end
    end)
    :build()

local p1 = Player.new()
p1:TakeDamage(20)
print(p1.Health) -- 80
```
